# amongus-taskbot

This bot automates your Among Us tasks. Just run the python file (after installing its dependecies) and it does it work automatically.
Behavior can vary on different screen resolutions. I tested it on a 1920 x 1080 screen.

Tasks automated so far:
- Connecting wires
- Divert power part 1 (moving a lever) and part 2 (clicking on a tube)
